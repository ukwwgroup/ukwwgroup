                    <h4>UKWW Group of Companies</h4>
                    <p>UK SERVICE MANAGEMENT ensures that the transition processes are streamlined, effective and efficient so that the risk of delay is minimized. It establishes assurance of the expected and actual service deliverables, and integrates elements that each service depends on to deliver and operate the service successfully. These elements include applications, infrastructure, knowledge, documentation, facilities, finance, people, processes, skills and so on. Many organizations deliver significant change through formal projects, and the failure to ensure that projects address the full service management and operational requirements as well as the functional requirements can be a costly, or even fatal, mistake to an organization. </p>
